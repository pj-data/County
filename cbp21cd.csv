3,"County Business Patterns data includes employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location). These employers are included under a ""statewide"" classification in county-level tables. Statewide cases are not included in any particular congressional district (though they would be included in at-large districts). This incomplete detail may cause a slight understatement of a district's total data. ",,,,,,,,,,
